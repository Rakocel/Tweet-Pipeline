    "+ build a data pippeline that collect tweets and stores them in a database (MongoDB - noSQL) per streaming. Next, the sentiment of tweets is analyzed and the annotated tweets are stored in a second (postgreSQL - SQL)database. \n",
    "+ These different actio were initiated within a Docker container. \n",
    "+ As for the Twitter API the authentication keys need to be added in a 'config.txt' file in the subfolder 'tweet_collector' or directly inserted into the 'get_tweets.py' file\n",
    "+ To make this project run, it is neccesary to have Docker installed. As a next step the docker-compose-yml file needs to be run. "
